# Launch School - Notes and Exercises

Hello my name is Ben Groneman. I am an avid software engineer with a passion for solving problems that benefit the end user experience.

I started the Launch school program in March 2020. This repository is meant to be a one stop shop for all of my notes, exercises, comments, and epiphanies.
