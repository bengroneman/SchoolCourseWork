# Final assessment thoughts

## My education and professional background
Hello there,

My name is Ben Groneman, I an independent software engineer aiming to build healthy communities built around technology.
I have a degree in Computer Science, and a majority of work has been in the web development realm. I started my path into software engineering because of my passion for both problem solving, and a love for computers.

From a professional lens I have a diverse background in customer service, marketing, engineering, and design. I started an internship with a web agency, and then came back the following year as a front end developer. After building two websites with this web agency, I began working with NOLS as a web intern, I built front end website features, microsites, and fixed bugs. Shortly after this internship I began working as the digitial campaign coordinator for NOLS. I had just recently graduated from CWC in a Computer Science program so I applied my engineering skills to solve everyday business challenges at NOLS, using Python I was able to automate away about 140 hours worth of manual labor away from my job and other internal roles.

Outside of a professional lens I am active technology hobbyist, I love my raspberry pi, and have tinkered with at home projcets for home, and garden automatino, and am currently working on designing a personal budget application using Plaid. Through peer mentorship, open source and shared knowledge I have been able to teach myself coding. Though I have experience building software for clients, I still find myself struggling with the fundamentals, which is whY I am here today. I am motivated and excited to learn more about the fundamentals of software engineering!

## Your goal after finishing Launch School.
My main goal after I crush the launch school core curriculum will be to assert my self into a Software Engineering role that is with a company that shares similar values to myself. I am interested in the Capstone program, but want to see how things pan out before I commit to that.

As I mentioned previously I really am thrilled about building healthy comm;unities built around technology, and I am excited to apply my technical skills to further this mission. I intend to study hard and learn a ton, so that I can leave this program feeling accomplished and knowledgable. 

## How you discovered Launch School.
I stumbled upon the launch school website while searching for degree programs focused on Software Engineering. I found it hard to swallow a large university bill and knew there had to be another way. So after extensive research I landed on Launch School, because a mastery based learning approach feels more valuable to me than other offerings.  

## What is your impression of the Prep courses that you just completed?
My overall first impression is gleaminlgy positive, I have found the content to be both well written and engaging. I found the exercises and reading a breeze at times, but they really did reveal some edge cases that made me go "huh? isn't that neat."
For example:
- 
### Which parts were easy for you?
Coming with a background of JS and Python I found the syntax relatively easy to pick up on, and am happy to have some new syntax in my toolbelt.

### Which were difficult?
Some of the exercises were challenging and helped me to reinforce my muscle memory for the language.

### What did you enjoy?
I really enjoyed the writing, I never watched any of the videos because I just thought the writing conveyed the concepts so well. This is a skill and feature that I find to be incredibly crucial during development. I would like to focus on writing excellent documentation on the software that I write. 

### What didn't you like?


### How long did it take you to complete the Prep courses end-to-end?
I intend to pursue the Ruby track, so starting with that one took me about 2-3 weeks to complete, now that is defintely a ball park number, because I had started just before Covid began, and that kind of threw a wrench in my process. Though I am here today, excited and ready to learn. I spent about 1-2 weeks working through the JavaScript prep courses.
