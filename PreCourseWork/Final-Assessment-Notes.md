# Final assessment thoughts

## My education and professional background
I started my path into software engineering as a young lad looking to make an honest living by building cool things. I still maintain that goal of building cool things, however I have focused my efforts on encouraging healthy communities through the use of technology. <Tell me more>
I began working for a small web and marketing agency to build out websites. I taught myself everything I know about coding via online resources and curious tinkering. After building two websites on the Wordpress platform I began working with NOLS as a web intern, I built front end website features microsites, and some marketing work as well. Shortly after this internship I began working as the digitial campaign coordinator for NOLS. I had just recently graduated from CWC in a Computer Science program so I applied my engineering skills to solve everyday business challenges at NOLS, using Python I was able to automate away about 140 hours worrth of manual labor away from my job and other internal roles.

## Your goal after finishing Launch School.
My main objective after I succesffully crush Launch School will be to assert my self into a Software Engineering role that is with a company that shares similar values to myself.
As I mentioned previously I really am thrilled about building healthy comm;unities built around technology, and I am excited to apply my technical skills to further this mission. I intend to study hard and learn a ton. 

## How you discovered Launch School.
I stumbled upon the launch school website while searching for degree programs focused on Software Engineering. I found it hard to swallow a large university bill and knew there had to be another way. 

## What is your impression of the Prep courses that you just completed?
My overall first impression is gleaminlgy positive, I have found the content to be both well written and engaging. I found the exercises and reading a breeze at times, but they really did reveal some edge cases that made me go "huh? isn't that neat."
For example:
- 
### Which parts were easy for you?
Coming with a background of JS and Python I found the syntax relatively easy to pick up on, and am happy to have some new syntax in my toolbelt.

### Which were difficult?
Some of the exercises were challenging and helped me to reinforce my muscle memory for the language.

### What did you enjoy?
I really enjoyed the writing, I never watched any of the videos because I just thought the writing conveyed the concepts so well. This is a skill and feature that I find to be incredibly crucial during development. I would like to focus on writing excellent documentation on the software that I write. 

### What didn't you like?


### How long did it take you to complete the Prep courses end-to-end?
- Hours:
- - JS Track:
